# Rookruit
Rookruit will ~~hopefully~~ serve as a hub for new designers & developers to recruit each other to collaborate on small projects. 

It aims to solve the issue of beginners wanting to try building something with others, but lacking enough confidence in their current skill level to commit to a hackathon.

Planned Features
  - Posts page containing searchable/filterable posts by designers/developers
  - Accounts that can be reviewed or rated by other members they've collaborated with (to help avoid bad team members)
  - Profile pages where users can link to their previous projects, socials, write an intro, etc
  - Simple private message/inbox system for reaching out to users or sharing links privately (Discord server invites, etc)
