I feel like I'm always spending more of my time struggling to get a working design done than actually coding. I was planning to make a prototype for a resturant's website and would love to collaborate on it with someone struggling with the coding side. I'll deploy it at the end and we both can throw it on our portfolios after! Let me know if interested: dan@example.com"
